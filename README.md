# le_krypt

This is a messy place where I put the libraries I create as part of my research in zk, zkML, quantum computing, and bioinformatics. If you find any disorder, I apologize, but I try to keep the journal of this workspace up to date. Contact me to discuss at elielmathe (WrapCast, TG, and X).

Feel free to let me know if youâ€™d like any adjustments!  

# Libraries 
- [ ] el_stark : A zero knowledge proof library for zk. It is based on STARKs and zkSNARKs.
